# Vehicle Tracking App

The Vehicle Tracking App is a web application built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Mantine UI**, **Chart.js**, **Leaflet.js**, and **Axios**. It utilizes the power of **MockAPI** to leverage curated data specifically tailored for this project. This app allows users to track and manage vehicles efficiently, providing various features for a seamless experience.

## Demo

## Features

### 1. Dashboard

The Dashboard is the central feature of the app, offering a comprehensive view of vehicle tracking data. It includes:

- **Map**: The dashboard displays a map that shows the real-time positions of vehicles. Each vehicle is represented by a marker on the map.

- **Search by Car Name**: Users can search for specific vehicles by entering the car's name in the search bar. The app filters the displayed vehicles based on the search query.

- **Filter by Status**: Users can filter vehicles based on their status, which can be "Idle" or "Moving." This filter helps users focus on vehicles that match their criteria.

- **Interactive Map**: When users click on a vehicle card in the list, the app highlights the corresponding marker on the map, making it easy to identify a specific vehicle's location.

### 2. Analytics

The Analytics section provides users with insightful statistics and visualizations related to the tracked vehicles. It includes:

- **Charts**: Interactive charts powered by Chart.js visualize various vehicle-related data, such as vehicle status distribution, distances traveled, or fuel consumption.

- **Statistics**: Detailed statistics and key performance indicators (KPIs) are presented, offering valuable insights into the fleet's performance.

### 3. CRUD Vehicle Management (Fake but Functional)

The app provides the functionality for managing vehicles, even though the data is not persisted and is only simulated. This includes:

- **Add Vehicles**: Users can add new vehicles to the system, providing essential details such as vehicle name, type, status, and initial location. Please note that the data is not permanently stored.

- **View Vehicle Details**: Detailed information about each vehicle is accessible, providing users with a comprehensive overview of the vehicle's properties and status.

- **Update Vehicle Information**: Users can edit and update vehicle details, including name, type, status, and location. These changes are temporary and will not persist beyond the current session.

- **Delete Vehicles**: When necessary, users can remove vehicles from the system. However, this action is not permanent and will only affect the current session's data.

The fake but functional CRUD functionality is designed to demonstrate the app's capabilities and user interface for managing vehicles.
